This project is a building design generation model using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based on the Pix2Pix architecture. It employs a U-Net architecture for the generator and a PatchGAN for the discriminator. The model was trained on paired facade-to-building images for up to 50,000 steps to generate realistic architectural designs.
